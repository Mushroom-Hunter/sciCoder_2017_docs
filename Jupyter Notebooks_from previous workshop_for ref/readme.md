## Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of notebooks that have been written for past SciCoder workshops (mostly by Adrian Price-Whelan). These are provided as examples of not only how to use notebooks, but introductions to Matplotlib, SciPy, Cython, and other odds and ends (with a strong astronomy bias).

It's possible that not every link works and that some information might be a little out of date, but overall you should find the information in the notebooks useful.
